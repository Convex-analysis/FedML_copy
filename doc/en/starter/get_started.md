# Get Started

Thank you for coming! This tutorial is a quick tour of FedML Open Source Library ([https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML)) and MLOps Platform ([https://open.fedml.ai](https://open.fedml.ai)) with examples in different scenario. 

## **FedML Feature Overview**
![image](../../_static/image/4animals.png)

FedML logo reflects the mission of FedML Inc. FedML aims to build simple and versatile APIs for machine learning running anywhere at any scale.
In other words, FedML supports both federated learning for data silos and distributed training for acceleration with MLOps and Open Source support, covering cutting-edge academia research and industrial grade use cases. 

- **FedML Cheetah** - Accelerate Model Training with User-friendly Distributed Training
- **FedML Parrot** - Simulating federated learning in the real world (1) simulate FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)
- **FedML Octopus** - Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training, including Python-based edge SDK.
- **FedML Beehive** - Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs, including edge SDK for Android/iOS and embedded Linux.

- **FedML MLOps**: FedML's machine learning operation pipeline for AI running anywhere at any scale.
- **Model Serving**: we focus on providing a better user experience for edge AI.

## **Quick Start for Open Source Library**
[https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML)

### Installation

To get started, let's install FedML first.

```Python
pip install fedml
```
For more installation methods, please refer to [installing FedML](./installation.md).

### Simplified APIs

Our philosophy of API design is to reduce the number of APIs to as few as possible while simultaneously keeping the flexibility.

For Simplicity, FedML Parrot has only one line API as the following example:

```Python
import fedml

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fedml.run_simulation()
```

For flexibility, one-line API can also be expanded into five lines of APIs. Taking FedML Octopus as an example, the FL Client APIs are as follows:

```Python
import fedml
from fedml.cross_silo import Client

if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = fedml.init()

    # init device
    device = fedml.device.get_device(args)

    # load data
    dataset, output_dim = fedml.data.load(args)

    # load model
    model = fedml.model.create(args, output_dim)

    # start training
    client = Client(args, device, dataset, model)
    client.run()

```

With these APIs, you only need to tune the hyper-parameters with the configuration file `fedml_config.yaml`. An example is as follows:
```yaml
common_args:
  training_type: "cross_device"
  using_mlops: false
  random_seed: 0

data_args:
  dataset: "mnist"
  data_cache_dir: "../../../data/mnist"
  partition_method: "hetero"
  partition_alpha: 0.5

model_args:
  model: "lr"
  model_file_cache_folder: "./model_file_cache" # will be filled by the server automatically
  global_model_file_path: "./model_file_cache/global_model.mnn"

train_args:
  federated_optimizer: "FedAvg"
  client_id_list: "[138, 27]"
  client_num_in_total: 1000
  client_num_per_round: 2
  comm_round: 50
  epochs: 1
  batch_size: 100
  batch_num: -1
  client_optimizer: sgd
  learning_rate: 0.03
  weight_decay: 0.001

validation_args:
  frequency_of_the_test: 5

device_args:
  worker_num: 1 # this only reflects on the client number, not including the server
  using_gpu: false

comm_args:
  backend: "MQTT_S3_MNN"

tracking_args:
  log_file_dir: ./log
```

Now let's run some examples as follows to get a sense of how FedML simplifies federated learning in diverse real-world settings.
 
#### **FedML Parrot Examples**
Simulation with a Single Process (Standalone):

- [sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./../simulation/examples/sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): 
  Simulating FL using a single process in your personal laptop or server. This is helpful when researchers hope to try a quick algorithmic idea in small synthetic datasets (MNIST, shakespeare, etc.) and small models (ResNet-18, Logistic Regression, etc.). 

Simulation with Message Passing Interface (MPI):
- [mpi_torch_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./../simulation/examples/mpi_torch_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): 
  MPI-based Federated Learning for cross-GPU/CPU servers.
  

Simulation with NCCL-based MPI (the fastest training):
- In case your cross-GPU bandwidth is high (e.g., InfiniBand, NVLink, EFA, etc.), we suggest using this NCCL-based MPI FL simulator to accelerate your development. 

#### **FedML Octopu Exampless**
Horizontal Federated Learning:

- [mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./../cross-silo/examples/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): an example to illustrate how to run horizontal federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.)

Hierarchical Federated Learning:

- [hierarchical_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./../cross-silo/examples/hierarchical_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): an example to illustrate how to run hierarchical federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.). 
Here `hierarchical` means that inside each FL Client (data silo), there are multiple GPUs that can run local distributed training with PyTorch DDP, and then the FL server aggregates globally from the results received from all FL Clients.

## **MLOps User Guide**
[https://open.fedml.ai](https://open.fedml.ai)

Currently, the project developed based on FedML Octopus (cross-silo) and Beehive (cross-device) can be smoothly deployed into the real-world system using FedML MLOps.

FedML MLOps Platform simplifies the workflow of federated learning anywhere at any scale.
It enables zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning.
It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various users/silos/edge nodes, without the need to centralize any data to the cloud, hence providing maximum privacy and efficiency.

The above figure shows the workflow. Such a workflow is handled by web UI without the need to handle complex deployment. Check the following live demo for details:
